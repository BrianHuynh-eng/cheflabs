<!-- Ask the user to manually enter the deliveries per week for this product; this value is completely up to the user to decide, and, by logic, should be consistent; NOTE: Add a note for edge cases: Deliveries that come once every, say, two weeks, or four weeks; in this case, make the user divided 1 in half, 0.5 for deliveries every two weeks and in half again to 0.25 for every three weeks -->
