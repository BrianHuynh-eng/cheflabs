<!-- Recommend user to generate new, refreshed reports daily; add an Apple settings type of note -->
<!-- Add a button called 'Generate Inventory Cost Report' -->
<!-- Add a note saying that the theoretical and actual COGS are only available in the end of the accounting period and the actual, finalized results of the restuarant's profitability -->
<!-- Compare between this actual gross profit versus the gross profit that the restaurant could have made had not been for the inventory wastage; emphasize this!!! -->
<!-- If the beginning or ending inventory resulted in a None, this occurs due to the user starting Cheflabs after the beginning of the accounting period; they would need to manually enter their beginning inventory; this should happen only once -->
<!-- For current_cogs: COGS are typically calculated at the end of the accounting period; however, we want to check the current, up-to-date COGS rather than seeing it in the end of the accounting period; this value should be exactly the same as the actual_cogs in the end of the accounting period; make sure to leave a message telling uers to send a report to the developer if this is not the case -->
