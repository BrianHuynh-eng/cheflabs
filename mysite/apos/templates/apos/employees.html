<!-- Tell the owner to add themselves into Employees and create a new account for every location; this is similar to AWS's IAM user, where each IAM user has different permissions; for Cheflab's case, each "IAM user" will have different external locations; make them create a location once they have added a RegionLocation and ExternalLocation -->
<!-- If they are not the owner, hide the unique_identifier field -->
<!-- For the availability, recommend the user to follow a format for ease of readability -->
<!-- Provide the password formula for the employers: If their first name has more than two letters, the password format is as follows: First three letters of their first name, first three letters of their last name, last two digits of their phone number, first letter of their job position (capitalized), the '@' symbol, first three letters of their email; there should be no spacing; for people who have a first name of less than or equal to two letters, the first name and last name will be the first two letters -->
